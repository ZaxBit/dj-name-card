I have a Vite + Vanilla JS project with GSAP already imported in main.js.
Build me a personal name card inside the existing #card div.
Write the HTML into index.html, CSS into style.css, and animations into main.js.

Here's what I want:
- My name: [Name]
- My role: [Role]
- Vibe / mood: [e.g. "dark and minimal, like a luxury brand"]
- Color palette: [e.g. "near-black background, electric lime accent"]
- Typography feeling: [e.g. "oversized serif name, tiny mono for the details"]
- Animation on load: [e.g. "each letter of my name drops in one by one"]
- Animation on hover: [e.g. "the card tilts in 3D as my cursor moves across it"]
- One extra detail: [e.g. "a slow animated gradient behind everything"]

Use GSAP for all animations. Make it feel like a real portfolio piece, not a template.
